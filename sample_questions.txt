By attaching a fluorescently-labelled actin filament to the gamma subunit of this complex, Noji and Yoshida showed that the catalytic domain rotates in discrete 120-degree steps. Although much smaller than a bacterial flagellum, Paul Boyer described this enzyme as a ‘splendid molecular machine’, due to the near-100% efficiency of its rotary motor mechanism.

TOSSUP: There is exactly one structure with this property for a topological manifold in dimensions lower than four. Both the real and imaginary parts of complex functions with this property are harmonic, and complex functions with this property satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann (“koh-SHEE REE-man”) conditions. Given a function f that has this property in some neighborhood, its inverse function g will also have this property if the Jacobian determinant of f is nonzero. All the entries in the Jacobian matrix must exist for a multivariable function to have this property. Real analytic functions have this property “infinitely,” and are equal to an infinite power series. Single-variable functions lack this property if their graphs have corners or cusps. For 10 points, name this property of functions that have linear approximations at every point.
