Antonio Damasio proposed that this phenomenon’s “core” and “extended” types are preceded by the existence of a “protoself.” This phenomenon is distributed across parallel receiving processes in Bernard Baars’s “global (*)</strong> workspace model.” Christof Koch and Francis Crick argued that this phenomenon arises from binding through synchronous oscillation as part of a project to identify its “neural correlates.” This phenomenon only arises retrospectively according to the “multiple drafts” model, which rejects the “Cartesian theatre” metaphor. For 10 points, name this phenomenon whose “hard” problem concerns explaining qualia.",

Narrow resonances around 3100 and 3700 mega-electron-volts measured using the SPEAR positron–electron accelerating ring at SLAC correspond to different bound states including this particle. Those resonances are narrow because particles composed of this particle and its antiparticle are forbidden to decay by the (*) OZI rule.

It’s not epilepsy or seizures, but when these events last longer than 72 hours, they are called “status” and are treated with injections of dihydroergotamine (“di-hydro-er-GOT-uh-meen”). Mutations in ATP1A2 or CACNA1A cause the familial hemiplegic form of these events. Prophylactic medications for these events include beta-blockers, topiramate, and valproic acid. The monoclonal antibody eptinezumab targets the CGRP receptor to prevent these events. A group of medications that target 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors are used to abort these events; those medications are triptans. These events can be preceded by scintillating scotoma or other visual auras. These events usually occur with photophobia and phonophobia.

Two of these functional groups are formed by the sigmatropic rearrangement step in the Fischer indole synthesis. One of these functional groups is protonated and attacked by a cyanide group in the Strecker synthesis. This functional group is selectively reduced by sodium cyanoborohydride. Oximes (“OX-eems”) and hydrazones are hydroxyl and amine derivatives of this functional group, respectively. When these functional groups are alkyl or aryl substituted, they are called Schiff bases. They can be formed by a reaction between an aldehyde and primary amine. For 10 points, name these functional groups that contain a carbon–nitrogen double bond.",

It doesn’t involve amine groups, but a PLP cofactor is used in enzymes that catalyze this reaction, like transforming L-DOPA to dopamine, glutamic acid to GABA (“GAB-uh”), and histidine to histamine.

This functionality is biosynthesized by (*)</strong> NRPS from L-aminoadipic acid, L-cysteine, and D-valine with a final IPNS-catalyzed condensation step. A strategy for producing this moiety performs a 2+2 cycloaddition between a ketene and an imine and is named for Staudinger. Compounds with this moiety form a covalent bond to an enzyme responsible for crosslinking D-alanine-D-alanine peptide chains; that enzyme is DD-transpeptidase. For 10 points, name this moiety present in the carbapenem, cephalosporin, and penicillin antibiotics, which is distinguished by a four-membered cyclic amide group.",

        "formatted_text": "<strong>This phenomenon is present in the racemization of biphenyls with a “steric,” rather than “electronic,” explanation. Its “reverse form” is observed in alkyl metal hydrides undergoing reductive or beta-elimination, as the forming bond in the transition state has an agostic interaction with the metal center. This effect’s value can be much larger than its classical theoretical maximum value when the reaction (*)</strong> proceeds by quantum tunneling. Its strength is proportional to the product of a first term encoding the ratio of symmetry numbers for chemical species, a second term capturing the fraction of molecules in a vibrationally-excited state, and a third term equal to a ratio of vibrational zero-point energies. E2 reactions have a much larger value for this effect than E1 reactions because, in E2, the carbon-hydrogen bond is broken in the rate-determining step. For 10 points, name this effect defined as the ratio of reaction rates when different isotopes of the same element are present in the starting materials.",

In Drosophila, the protein “suppressor of white apricot” is a regulator of this process, as are other members of the SR family. A complex involved in this process contains the Smith antigens. This process requires a donor site, an acceptor site, and a branch point, the last of which is required to form a lariat (“LAIR-ee-it”). In some substrates in which this process occurs without protein (*)</strong> catalysis, it proceeds via two successive transesterification steps. Small nuclear ribo-nucleo-proteins, or snRNPs (“snurps”) catalyze this process, which can produce alternative isoforms of a single protein.

The <em>ovale</em> (“oh-VAL-ay”), <em>vivax</em>, and <em>falciparum</em> (“fal-SIP-uh-rum”) members of this genus most commonly infect humans, and are all carried by the common <em>Anopheles</em> (“uh-NOFF-uh-leez”) mosquito.

        "formatted_text": "<strong>Cabral and Leedom proposed a method for visualizing these mathematical objects called LIC, which assigns values to pixels using a convolution kernel. These objects and their components can be visualized using a quiver plot. Ugly animation flips result when one tries to visualize two of these objects in R3 that are both orthogonal to each other and non-zero at every point, due to a result called the hairy ball theorem. By traversing particles through a specific type of these objects, one can generate a (*)</strong> streamline and visualize a flow. If one of these objects is irrotational, then it is also conservative, meaning it is defined by the gradient of a function.

On aryl compounds, instead of undergoing nucleophilic substitution, strong acid halides like HCl reduce these functional groups to hydroxyl groups. Reacting an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA forms a cyclic one of these molecules in a reaction sometimes named for (*)</strong> Prilezhaev. Compounds with this functional group are formed by reacting an organohalide with a deprotonated alcohol in the Williamson synthesis. Trapping ions can be done using a “crown” made of this functional group whose diethyl variety saw use as an anesthetic.

Miles Kimball defined a quantity to measure this behavior and proved that a theory of it is isomorphic to the theory of precautionary saving. Agents with this behavior prefer lowering both the numerator and denominator of the Sharpe Ratio. Taking the negative of the second derivative of utility over the first derivative of utility at some point is positive for agents with this type of behavior; that equation defines the Arrow–Pratt measure for it. This behavior, which is preferred by agents with concave utility functions, is characterized by preference for diversification and avoidance of zero-mean lotteries. For 10 points, name this type of behavior that prefers safe payoffs over unsafe payoffs for the same expected value.",

Surfactants above the Krafft temperature readily form micelles above the critical micelle value for this quantity. Initial, change, and equilibrium values of this quantity are encoded into ICE tables. A first order reaction only depends linearly on this quantity for one of the reactants. For 10 points, name this quantity, commonly reported with molarity, the amount of solute in a solution.",
