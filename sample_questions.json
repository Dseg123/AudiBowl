The ratio of inertial forces to forces described by this effect is known as the Rossby number, and Rossby waves are driven by this effect, which creates a fictitious force acting perpendicular to the velocity of an observer in a rotating frame of reference. For 10 points, name this effect that causes hurricanes in the Northern hemisphere to rotate counter-clockwise.",

        "formatted_text": "This operator can be raised to a fractional power by diagonalising it using Hermite functions, and doing so gives the fractional form of this operation, which uses the Mehler kernel. The Wiener-Khinchin theorem states that the spectral power is related to the autocorrelation in this way. This operation is a unitary operator on the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the real line according to Plancherelâs theorem. An algorithm for performing this task numerically works best on grid sizes that are a power of 2 and was invented by Cooley and Tukey. This operation can be considered a two-sided Laplace transform with an imaginary frequency. For 10 points, name this integral transform that returns the frequency spectrum of a signal.",

Two esters are linked under basic conditions to form a beta-ketoester in one of these reactions. Darzens, Knoevenagel (âkâNUH-ven-AH-gulâ), and Dieckmann name examples of these reactions. Hydrolysis can reverse a form of polymerization that takes place through many of these reactions and that is contrasted with addition polymerization. For 10 points, name this class of reactions that shares its name with a vapor-to-liquid phase change.",

Integrating the Berry curvature over the first Brillouin (âbree-WANNâ) zone yields an integer that characterizes systems described by this term, the Chern number. According to the bulkâboundary correspondence, a (*)</strong> surface that separates regions with different values for an invariant described by this term will have conducting edge modes. A system described by this term was first realized in mercury telluride quantum wells and exhibits spin-momentum locking in its edge states. The winding number is an example of an invariant described by this term. For 10 points, give this term that describes insulators with conducting surface states.",

A theory starting with this word is used to computationally determine quantum mechanical properties of many body systems; that is a âfunctional theoryâ named for this quantity. This quantity, whose gradient is maximized along a pycnocline (âPICK-no-klyneâ), equals its âcriticalâ value for a flat universe. This quantity for electric current is symbolized with a vector <em>j</em>. Specific gravity is the ârelativeâ form of this quantity with respect to water. Among elements, this quantity is highest in osmium and iridium. For 10 points, rho often symbolizes what quantity, defined as mass over volume?",

Tenase activates a protein during this processâs namesake cascade. Glycosylation and the cleavage of a zymogen involved in this process produce Christmas factor. Heydeâs (âhideâsâ) syndrome is characterized by the degradation of von Willebrand factor, which also aids in this process. In this process, fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by thrombin.

High-intensity X-rays can be generated from these substances in a system called a z-pinch. In these substances, the magnetic field is âfrozen inâ according to AlfvÃ©nâs (âall-VANEâsâ) theorem. Various properties of these substances can be measured with a Langmuir (âLANG-myoorâ) probe. Magnetohydrodynamics models these substances, which are toroidally confined in tokamaks for fusion.

An abrupt increase in these two quantities in the Northern Atlantic is caused by the intrusion of MIW, which forms a distinct water mass below the common water. The meridional overturning circulation is primarily driven by gradients in these two quantities. Water in the Mediterranean Sea has high values of these quantities because of its low input and proximity to the Equator. These two quantities primarily determine the density of seawater, which is why Antarctic Bottom Water sinks.

George Smith invented a technique where peptide libraries are fused to a protein found in this structure in M13 as a way to evolve tight binders. The three proteins that compose this structure are symbolized VP1, VP2, and VP3 in a common gene therapy vector. A triangulation number, commonly one, three, or seven, characterizes the shape of these structures, which are often icosahedra composed of hexamers and pentamers. A lipid envelope surrounds this structure in HIV. For 10 points, name this structure that encases a virusâs genetic material.",

        "formatted_text": "Superfluids experience a type of this process due to waves of phonon density in which the normal and superfluid components oscillate out of phase, called second sound. A relation between different forms of this process includes the square root of the Reynolds number times the Prandtl number to the one-third power. That relation compares two types of this process in cylindrical systems and is the ChurchillâBernstein equation. The Biot (âbee-OHâ) number compares internal and external forms of this process across a surface, and the Nusselt number is the ratio of two different forms of this process. The rate of this process, which can happen when bodies are in contact or through bulk motion of a fluid, is proportional to delta-<em>T</em> according to Newtonâs Law of Cooling. For 10 points, name this transfer of energy exemplified by convection, conduction, and radiation.",

Two of these functional groups are formed by the sigmatropic rearrangement step in the Fischer indole synthesis. One of these functional groups is protonated and attacked by a cyanide group in the Strecker synthesis. This functional group is selectively reduced by sodium cyanoborohydride. Oximes (âOX-eemsâ) and hydrazones are hydroxyl and amine derivatives of this functional group, respectively. When these functional groups are alkyl or aryl substituted, they are called Schiff bases. They can be formed by a reaction between an aldehyde and primary amine. For 10 points, name these functional groups that contain a carbonânitrogen double bond.",

Another reaction of this type begins by adding thiohydroxyamate, then uses a radical initiator on tributyltin hydride. This reaction can occur spontaneously, with some catalytic amounts of acid, when a ketone is present beta to a certain functional group via a pericyclic mechanism. After forming a silver salt, bromine and CCl4 (âC-C-L-4â) can affect this transformation. This transformation, which occurs in reactions named for Kochi, Barton, and Hunsdiecker, is also the final step of malonic ester synthesis.

Confining a BoseâEinstein condensate in an optical lattice produces examples of these materials that lack coherence. As the potential depth of that lattice is decreased, the condensate transitions from one of these materials into a superfluid. The transition into these materials occurs when the density of electrons to the one-third power times the Bohr radius is greater than a critical value.

A tumor predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the (*)</strong> merlin gene sees the formation of bilateral benign tumors of these cells on cranial nerve VIII [eight] in neuroÂ·fibroÂ·matosis type II. They may have an âonion-bulbâ appearance on silver stain, and CharcotâMarieâToothâs disease causes their compensatory hyperplasia. A substance in these cells includes protein zero and galactoÂ·cerebroside and enables saltatory conduction, which is also performed by oligodendrocytes.

A 50-foot superconducting magnet was moved by barge from Brookhaven National Lab to Fermilab to conduct a new experiment in order to verify that a 3-sigma measured difference in one of these values from its prediction was real.

The creator of this thing worked with the engineer Joseph Clement, and George Scheutz completed the construction of this thing after its creator decided to pursue a career in politics instead of continuing to work on it. A series of treatises on this thing were published under the pseudonym A.A.L. This thing was originally created to assist with the production of the Royal Nautical Almanac, and funding for this thing was suspended by the British government in 1832 after progress on it stalled. This device was said to operate âas a Jacquard loom weaves patternsâ by an expert in operating it.

It's not hydrolysis, but in the cumene process, cumene hydroperoxide undergoes a reaction of this name to produce phenol and acetone. 1,5 dienes undergo this type of reaction with the addition of heat. In Mass-Spec, ion fragments containing a ketone can undergo this type of reaction. Bullvalene constantly undergoes a reaction of this type named for Cope, which is why bullvalene is classified as fluxional. Sigmatropic reactions are one subclass of this broader class of non-condensation reactions, two of which are named for Claisen and McLafferty.

Cypher and Gremlin are two popular languages that allow utilizing these statements with graphs. The Algebrizer binds these statements, which are broken down into various steps in an execution plan. A popular library that allows one to manipulate the JavaScript Document-Object Model shares its name with these statements. The efficiency of these statements can be significantly affected by their join order. âSELECT * <strong>(âstarâ)</strong> from tableâ is an example of one of these statements. For 10 points, a request from a database is known by what name, represented by the letter âQâ in the structured language SQL?",
